This project is a software to render and manipulate a 3D model using WebGL/three.js. I started by using a WebGL skeelton but 
most of the code in JavaScript has been written by me.  
I had to fulfill 10 requirements which were the following:
          - Draw a cube 
          - Draw a coordinate system axes 
          - Rotate the cube 
          - Rendering 
          - Translate the camera 
          - Orbit the camera 
          - Texture mapping 
          - Load a mesh model from .obj 
          - Rotate the mesh, render it in different modes 
          - Do something creative - I implemented a solar system :) 
For this coursework, I made a lot of use of the keyboard shortcuts. This file will act as an explanation of how to work with this software:
Keyboard keys:
"e" - shows the edges rendering
"f" - shows the face rendering
"v" - shows the vertices rendering 
"w" - moves the camera up
"s" - moves the camera down
"a" - moves the camera left
"d" - moves the camera right
"u" - moves the camera forward
"i" - moves the camera backward
"o" - orbits in latitude rotation
"l" - orbits in longitude rotation
"x" - rotates the cube along the x-axis
"y" - rotates the cube along the y-axis
"z" - rotates the cube along the z-axis
"c" - returns the cube in its normal position
"b" - shows the bunny's edges
"n" - shows the bunny's vertices
"m" - returns the bunny's texture/ shows the bunny
"q" - rotates the bunny along the x-axis
"r" - makes the solar system visible
"t" - rotates the solar system's objects along the y-axis
"g" - hides the solar system
