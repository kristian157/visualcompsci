For this coursework, I made a lot of use of the keyboard shortcuts. This file will act as an explanation of how to work with this software:
Keyboard keys:
"e" - shows the edges rendering
"f" - shows the face rendering
"v" - shows the vertices rendering 
"w" - moves the camera up
"s" - moves the camera down
"a" - moves the camera left
"d" - moves the camera right
"u" - moves the camera forward
"i" - moves the camera backward
"o" - orbits in latitude rotation
"l" - orbits in longitude rotation
"x" - rotates the cube along the x-axis
"y" - rotates the cube along the y-axis
"z" - rotates the cube along the z-axis
"c" - returns the cube in its normal position
"b" - shows the bunny's edges
"n" - shows the bunny's vertices
"m" - returns the bunny's texture/ shows the bunny
"q" - rotates the bunny along the x-axis
"r" - makes the solar system visible
"t" - rotates the solar system's objects along the y-axis
"g" - hides the solar system
